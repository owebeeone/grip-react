/**
 * GRIP Debounce Utility - Rate limiting for function calls
 * 
 * Provides a simple debouncing utility that limits the rate at which
 * functions can be called. Useful for preventing excessive function
 * calls during rapid state changes or user interactions.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Configurable delay period
 * - Customizable scheduler (default: setTimeout)
 * - Immediate execution for zero delay
 * - Automatic timer cleanup
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Rate limiting async operations
 * - Preventing excessive Tap updates
 * - User input throttling
 * - Performance optimization
