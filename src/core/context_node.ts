/**
 * GRIP Context Node Interface - Internal graph node management
 * 
 * Defines the interface for internal context nodes that represent GripContexts
 * in the GRIP graph. These nodes manage the relationships and state of contexts
 * without exposing the context itself as a public API.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Context nodes are internal implementation details
 * - They manage graph relationships and state
 * - They use weak references for GC-aware lifecycle management
 * - They coordinate with the GROK engine for graph operations
 * 
 * Lifetime Management:
 * - References to Drips are weak (allows GC of unused Drips)
 * - Drip references to ContextNodes are hard (keeps nodes alive while Drips exist)
 * - References to child ContextNodes are weak (allows GC of unused children)
 * - References to ProducerRecords are hard (keeps nodes alive while producers exist)
 * - References to Taps are hard (keeps nodes alive while Taps exist)
 * - Tap references to context nodes are hard (bidirectional strong references)
 * 
 * The ContextNode is kept alive as long as there are active Drips, active Taps,
 * or active children ContextNodes. This ensures proper cleanup when contexts
 * are no longer needed.
 * 
 * Note: This interface is not part of the public API. It is used internally
 * by the engine to manage the graph structure and relationships.
