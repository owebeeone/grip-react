/**
 * GRIP Context Containers - Context wrapper utilities
 * 
 * Provides container classes that wrap and manage multiple GripContexts,
 * enabling complex scenarios where different contexts are needed for
 * different purposes (e.g., home vs presentation contexts).
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Dual context management (home and presentation)
 * - Unified interface for multiple contexts
 * - GROK engine coordination
 * - Context hierarchy management
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - Tap matching with separate input and output contexts
 * - Complex context hierarchies
 * - Context delegation and composition
 * - Multi-context Tap management

/**
 * Dual-context container that manages home and presentation contexts.
 * 
 * The DualContextContainer provides a unified interface for managing
 * two separate contexts: a home context for inputs/parameters and a
 * presentation context for outputs. This is particularly useful for
 * Tap matching scenarios where the input and output contexts differ.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Home Context: Where inputs and parameters are read from
 * - Presentation Context: Where outputs are presented to consumers
 * - Unified GROK Engine: Both contexts share the same GROK instance
 * - GripContextLike Interface: Provides consistent API for consumers
 * 
 * This container is commonly used with TapMatcher to separate the
 * context where queries are evaluated (home) from the context where
 * selected Taps are activated (presentation).
