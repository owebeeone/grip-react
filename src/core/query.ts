/**
 * GRIP Query System - Declarative conditions for Tap selection
 * 
 * Provides a declarative way to specify conditions that determine which Taps
 * should be active based on Grip values. The query system enables dynamic
 * Tap selection through declarative conditions rather than imperative logic.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Declarative condition specification
 * - Equality and inclusion conditions
 * - Score-based Tap prioritization
 * - Fluent builder API
 * - Performance-optimized evaluation
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Query: Immutable condition specification
 * - QueryBuilder: Fluent API for building queries
 * - QueryConditions: Map of Grip conditions with match scores
 * - QueryMatchScoreMap: Map of value-to-score mappings
 * 
 * Performance Notes:
 * - Optimized for large numbers of query expressions
 * - Constant-time evaluation complexity
 * - Limited to equality and inclusion for performance
 * - Complex conditions should use FunctionTaps instead
