/**
 * GRIP Drip System - Live value streams for reactive data consumption
 *
 * A Drip represents a live value stream for a specific Grip within a GripContext.
 * It provides the consumer end of the data pipeline, allowing components to
 * subscribe to value updates and receive notifications when data changes.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Subscribable value streams with immediate and queued notifications
 * - Lifecycle callbacks for first subscriber and zero subscribers
 * - Deferred cleanup to handle transient resubscribe patterns
 * - Weak references to prevent memory leaks
